# Introduction 
In this project I have implemented a content based recommendation system based on multi_category products and electronic products. Three different approaches were used fort he recommendation system, the TF-IDF and cosine similarity approach and machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost approach. 


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package Installer)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnshulPatil2911/Content-based-recommendation-system.git
```

### Install the required packages

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the notebook
1. **Navigate to the Data directory*

   ```bash
   cd project/Data
   ```
2. **Load all the csv files from the drive path provided in the data_path text file**

3. **The csv files in the drive are preprocessed file, store them in a directory**

4. **Now you can directly run the Feature_engineering.ipyn in order to get the personalized recommendations**

5. **Before running the notebook ensure that the csv path are correctly provided in the notebook**

6. **In order to view the report navigate to the Report directory
   ```bash
   cd project/Report
   ```
7. The report contains the step followed for recommendations for all the approaches, feature engineering, feature selection, model training and results interpretation
